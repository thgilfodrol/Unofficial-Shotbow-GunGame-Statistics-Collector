# Unofficial-Shotbow-GunGame-Statistics-Collector
Welcome to the unofficial Shotbow GunGame statistics collector project page! I wrote this project after playing a couple of hours of the newly updated GunGame game there, at play.shotbow.net (standard port 25565), to satisfy my curiosity at the exact headshot rates as measured ingame.

This software is licensed with the MIT License, as described in source file headers and upon execution of the program.

If you would like to create your own set of data from your own client logs, feel free to run the pre-built .exe in the */SBGunGameStatisticsCollector/SBGunGameStatisticsCollector/bin/Debug* folder- you can also build your own from the source files.

Usage guide:  
1. Go to the startup location of the .exe file, and move any log file into it that contains the kill data you would like to track.  
2. Run the program.  
3. Enter the relative path of the file you would like it to read. For example, you can enter testgungame.log and press enter to compile a set of data for the example log file. It'll take a second or two to from there to compile the data.  
4. ???  
5. Profit! \o/  
6. The output will be written to console, and a full version will be stored to output.txt in the application's startup folder.
